# Project Report

##	Introduction

In today’s academic environment, all educational and administrative processes are based on digital connectivity, and a high-quality, scalable, and reliable network infrastructure is a crucial factor. The KN University network design project is a large-scale project that will design a modern multi-campus network for KN University as a prestigious educational establishment. The work includes the development of a complex network topology encompassing all campuses of KN University in Melbourne, Sydney, Brisbane, and Adelaide, which are mainly distinct with different infrastructure and demands.

The project's main objective is to build a highly available, redundant, secure, high-standard network for KN University. It can meet the university’s current operational requirements and potentially address future requirements. It covers the wired and the wireless infrastructure and integrates with the latest network technology to enhance robust performance, security and scalability. 
In addition to the basic computer networking components, the project integrates IoT devices as an essential component that increases client experiences, monitors and controls environment standards, and strengthens security. Cloud computing capacities are also embedded in the design to provide flexible and scalable resources that support the university’s academic and organisational activities.
The project employs a top-down network design approach, which involves analysing the organisation's requirements to develop the network design from the top of the OSI layer and then implement it. There are three layers in the hierarchical structure of the network: Core layer, Distribution Layer and Access Layer. The core layer connects all campuses via two ISP connections, the distribution layer contains redundant switches for high availability, and the access layer connects the end devices. The logical topology has been designed to comprise twin distribution switches to accommodate redundant switches and minimize unavailability due to faults in the existing equipment. 
Security is one of the main features of this design, and it is supported by VLAN segmentation, WPA3 encryption, and the 802. 1X authentication is used to ensure the security of resources in a university. Network design also contains a comprehensive risk assessment to identify and mitigate potential threats.
This document is the final report on the network design for the KN University project and includes information concerning the design process, generated technical artefacts, and outcomes achieved. It is intended for all the stakeholders, internal partners such as the university’s IT department, project mentors, and external evaluators, who would get comprehensive information about the approach used to design the network to align it with the strategies of KN University and the university’s mission to provide top-notch education and research options.
