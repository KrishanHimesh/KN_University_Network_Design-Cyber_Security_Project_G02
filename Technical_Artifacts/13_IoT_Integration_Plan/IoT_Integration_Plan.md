The security architecture for incorporating Internet of Things (IoT) devices into KN University's network is illustrated in the diagram. Access control to guarantee that only authorised users can interact with the system, device authentication to confirm that only authentic devices connect to the network, and encryption to safeguard data from unauthorised access are security measures for KN University's IoT integration. By isolating IoT devices, network segmentation further improves security by reducing the effect of potential intrusions. All these steps work together to guarantee the safe processing of the data generated by IoT devices and their safe operation throughout the campus.
The image above essentially shows how KN University uses segmentation, access control, authentication, and encryption in conjunction with cloud computing and safe data storage to guarantee the security and appropriate management of its IoT devices and the data they produce.
