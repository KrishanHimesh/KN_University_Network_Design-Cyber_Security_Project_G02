# Key_Components

## Firewalls
- Purpose: Their basic purpose is to make a barrier between a trusted internal network, and untrusted external networks, like the web. Thusly, firewalls help safeguard against unapproved access, cyber threats, and data breaches. Example: Norton 360 Suite
  
## Types:
-   Perimeter Firewalls: Their basic role is to make a barrier between a trusted internal network, and untrusted external networks, like the web. Thusly, firewalls help safeguard against unapproved access, cyber threats, and data breaches.
-   Internal Firewalls: Internal firewalls, otherwise called segmenting firewalls, are deployed inside an internal network to make various security zones. Internal firewalls can detach basic or delicate areas like finance, HR, or innovative work from the rest of the network.
  
## Intrusion_Detection_and_Prevention_Systems_(IDPS)
-  Purpose: Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems (IDPS) are intended to identify and prevent malicious activities inside a network or framework. They play a significant part in cybersecurity by recognizing expected dangers, cautioning administrators, and making mechanized moves to mitigate risks.
  
## Types:
-  Network-based IDPS: Network-Based IDPS (NIDPS) are deployed to monitor and dissect network traffic for indications of malicious movement. They are commonly situated at key points within a network, like gateways, switches, and routers, to give extensive oversight of the data coursing through the network.
-  Host-based IDPS: Host Based IDPS (HIDPS) are introduced directly on individual devices or hosts, like servers, workstations, or endpoints. They focus on observing and examining activities well defined for each host to detect and prevent threats.
  
## Virtual_Private_Network_(VPN)
-  Purpose: A Virtual Private Network (VPN) is a technology that gives secure remote admittance to a network over the web. VPNs utilize solid encryption conventions to safeguard information on the way, guaranteeing that any captured information is unreadable without the encryption keys.
  
## Types:
-  Site-to-Site VPN: A Site-to-Site VPN is a method used to safely connect at least two or more networks, commonly corporate or hierarchical LANs, over the web. The main role of a Site-to-Site VPN is to safely connect geographically scattered campuses, permitting them to share assets and information safely over a public network like the internet.
-  Client-to-Site VPN: A Client-to-Site VPN, otherwise called Remote Access VPN, permits individual clients to interface with a private network from remote areas. The main role of a client-to-Site VPN is to give remote clients secure and encrypted access to an organization's internal network. This guarantees that sensitive information and communications stay secured, in any event, when accessed over possibly unreliable public networks like home Wi-Fi or public hotspots.
  
## Encryption: 
-  Encryption is a security process that changes data into an encoded design, making it unreadable to unauthorized users. Strong encryption algorithms, for example, AES-256, give a strong safeguard against cyber threats, ensuring the secrecy and security of data sent over possibly insecure networks.

## Access_Control
-  Purpose: Access control is a safety measure that manages who or what can view or use resources in a computing environment. The basic role of access control is to restrict access to delicate data and critical frameworks in view of user roles and consents.
  
### Mechanisms:
-   Role-Based Access Control (RBAC): RBAC is a method for managing access to assets based on the roles of individual clients inside an organization. The main role of RBAC is to simplify and smooth out the management of client permissions by allotting roles instead of individual permissions to every client. This approach guarantees that clients have fitting access based on their work capabilities and obligations.
-   Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA): MFA is a security mechanism that expects clients to give at least two or more verification factors to get access to a resource. The basic role of MFA is to diminish the risk of unapproved access by guaranteeing that regardless of whether one validation factor is compromised, other factors are required to get access.

# Security_Information_and_Event_Management_(SIEM)
-   Purpose: Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) is a comprehensive approach to deal with cyber security that consolidates Security Information Management (SIM) and Security Event Management (SEM) to provide real-time analysis, monitoring, and reaction to security events inside an organization. The main role of SIEM is to improve a network security pose by giving incorporated perceivability into network activities, distinguishing potential security dangers, and empowering quick reaction to incidents.
  
## Features:
-   Log Management: Log management refers to the process of gathering, storing, and analysing log information created by different gadgets, applications, and frameworks inside a network. SIEM frameworks gather log information from many sources, including network gadgets (routers, switches), security machines (firewalls, IDS/IPS), servers, applications, and endpoint gadgets.
-   Event Correlation: Event correlation is the method involved with analysing and corresponding log information from various sources to identify patterns and detect potential security dangers. SIEM frameworks use predefined rules, heuristics, and progressed examination to correlate events and create significant security cautions.
-   Incident Response: Incident response refers to the actions initiated by a university to distinguish, examine, and respond to security occurrences. SIEM systems play a critical part in working with and automating the incident response process.

# Patch_Management
-  Purpose: The purpose of patch management is to guarantee that product and frameworks are up to date with the latest patches and updates. This is urgent for keeping up with the security, stability, and performance of systems.
  
## Process:
-  Inventory Management: Inventory management includes maintaining a comprehensive list of all products, applications, and frameworks inside an organization.
-  Patch Deployment: Patch deployment is the process of applying patches to programming and frameworks to address weaknesses, fix bugs, or improve functionality.
-  Testing: Testing includes approving that patches and updates are applied accurately and don't present new issues or conflicts.

## Policies_and_Procedures
-  Network Security Policy: The Network Security Policy lays out rules and guidelines for safeguarding an organization's network foundation. Clients ought to just approach the network resources important for their roles.
-  Guidelines: 
### Incident_Response_Plan
-  Steps: Detection, analysis, containment, eradication, recovery, and lessons learned.
Data Protection Policy
- Components: Data classification, handling procedures.
### User_Training
- Topics: Phishing, password management, and safe internet use.

# Risk_Management
## Risk_Assessment
-  Purpose: Risk evaluation is an essential part of risk management. Its main role is to identify, assess, and focus on risks to an association's resources, tasks, and goals. By understanding these dangers, associations can develop methodologies to mitigate or manage them effectively, guaranteeing the continuity and strength of their operations.
  
## Risk_Mitigation
- Risk mitigation implies implementing strategies and activities to decrease the probability and effect of identified risks. The objective is to limit likely dangers and weaknesses, consequently safeguarding a network resources, tasks, and goals. Convey firewalls to control and screen network traffic, preventing unapproved access and alleviating outer dangers. Occasionally survey and update security approaches and methods to guarantee they stay important and successful in tending to current dangers. Provide training on general 
security practices, including perceiving phishing attempts, safe web use, and legitimate treatment of sensitive data.

## Continuous_Monitoring
-  Persistent checking includes the continuous perception of a university's IT environment to identify and respond to security dangers and performance issues progressively. Network observing devices track the performance, accessibility, and security of network framework. They give bits of knowledge into network traffic, gadget status, and potential issues that could affect network performance or security.
