# Cloud Integration Plan
## Cloud Integration Plan:
A Cloud Integration Plan outlines how an organization will interface its current IT systems and applications with cloud services. The objective is to guarantee consistent communication and interoperability between on-premises frameworks and cloud-based assets, upgrading activities, versatility, and adaptability.

### Components:
- Cloud Service Providers:
There are different cloud service providers in the market i.e. Azure Cloud, IBM Cloud, Google Cloud etc. For this project, Azure Cloud will be used for the demonstration as well as for other purposes. 
Cloud Integration Strategy:
- Hybrid Cloud Model: The Hybrid Cloud Model incorporates on-premises framework with public cloud services to establish a unified computing environment.
- Cloud Gateway: A Cloud Gateway is an innovation or administration that works with secure availability between an association's on-premises network and public cloud services. It acts as an entry point that manages and secures the data.

### Information and Application Migration:
- Information Migration: Move information to cloud storage with insignificant margin time.
- Application Migration: Move applications to the cloud while guaranteeing similarity and execution.

### Security and Consistence:
- Information Encryption: Encode information stored and sent to the cloud.
- Access Control: Carry out IAM (Identity and Access Management) strategies for cloud assets.

### Backup and Redundancy:
- Cloud Backup: Routinely back up basic information to cloud storage i.e. Microsoft Azure Cloud Backup.
- Disaster Recovery: Use cloud administrations for disaster recovery to guarantee business coherence.
