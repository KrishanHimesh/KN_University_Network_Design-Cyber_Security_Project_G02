# Network Topology Diagrams

## Overview
The network topology diagrams for KN University detail network components' physical and logical arrangements across its four campuses: Melbourne, Sydney, Brisbane, and Adelaide. Every campus has numerous floors, and every floor is divided into subnets and network devices. If we talk about the real-life requirements of a university, they will require more IP addresses, so based on that, subnets will be planned.
## 1. Physical Network Topology Diagram
This diagram shows the location of the network components, including the routers, switches, access points, servers and workstations on all floors of each campus building.
### Physical Network Topology Elements:
-	Routers: Integrate each floorâ€™s LAN to the main WAN.
-	Switches: Distribute the network traffic at each area.
-	Access Points: Ensure that all campus buildings have Wi-Fi connectivity.
-	Servers: Host several university services and applications.
-	Firewalls: Safeguard the network from external threats.
-	Workstations: Used by students, faculties, and university staff.
-	Central WAN: Connects all campuses
-	Internet Gateway: A single high-speed internet connection that protects the access point with firewalls
-	Campus LANs: Every building within the campuses with floors linked by routers and switches
