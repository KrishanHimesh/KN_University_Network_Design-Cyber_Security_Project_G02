## Components:
## Network Monitoring:
-  Devices: Use network observing tools to track performance metrics like bandwidth usage, dormancy, and packet loss.
-  Cautions: Design alarms for performance issues or organization abnormalities.
  
## Traffic Management:
-  Quality of Service (QoS): Execute QoS strategies to focus on basic applications and manage bandwidth usage.
-  Load Balancing: Use load balancers to circulate traffic equitably across servers and prevent bottlenecks.
  
## Performance Tuning:
-  Network Setup: Upgrade router and switch arrangements for better performance.
-  Caching: Execute caching solutions for lessen latency and further develop reaction times.
  
## Capacity Planning:
-  Scalability: Plan for future development by consistently evaluating network capacity and performance necessities.
-  Upgrades: Upgrade network framework on a case-by-case basis to deal with expanded traffic and new applications.
