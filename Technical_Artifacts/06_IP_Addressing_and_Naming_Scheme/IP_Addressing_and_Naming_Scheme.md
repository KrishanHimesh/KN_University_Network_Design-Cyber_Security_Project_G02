# IP Addressing and Naming Scheme

## IP Addressing Scheme
The IP addressing and the subnetting required for security purposes and for the proper establishment of access control will be under the line of user communities. VLANs will also be an additional but internal subnet in a particular community. Moreover, an internet VPN tunnel between the four campuses will be developed to ensure secure communication between the four campuses: Melbourne, Sydney, Brisbane, and Adelaide. This setup enhances security in communication between the various campuses and provides easy access to some vital resources.

## VLAN Implementation
These will be further split into VLANs to increase the network's security level. Every user community will be assigned different VLANs for wireless and common devices.

### VLAN Configuration by User Community
